# Project2_Ecommerce_Analysis
This project was developed as part of the Data Analysis course from EBAC, during the "Data Manipulation with Python" module. The objective was to analyze data from a fictional e-commerce platform provided by the course. The dataset was cleaned, processed, and prepared to enable more accurate analyses. Finally, a Dash application was built to make it easier to visualize the insights gained. The source code for the Dash application is included in the project files.
